**reactor** is a nuclear reactor simulation which is heavily inspired by Higgsino Physics' video [Chernobyl Visually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3oKNE72EzU)  
It is a Java application built on Processing's PApplet framework.

Neutrons can interact with Uranium atoms, and get absorbed. This fission reaction results in 3 neutrons being released. The goal of a nuclear reactor is to balance the process of new neutrons being created with interactions that remove neutrons. In this simulation, the reactor tries to maintain a stable reaction, in which each neutron should have roughly a 1/3 chance of hitting a Uranium atom, and a 2/3 chance of being absorbed or otherwise not interacting with any Uranium.
